# VIT Portal API

This repository contains a simple API built using Prolog and Python to perform inference on a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) and check eligibility statuses for a student portal system. The API provides endpoints for checking **exam permission** and **scholarship eligibility** based on student data, with Monte Carlo simulation implemented to calculate conditional probabilities.

**Features:**
- Check **exam permission** based on student attendance.
- Check **scholarship eligibility** based on CGPA and attendance.
- Simple frontend interface to interact with the API.
  
**Technologies Used:**
- Prolog for logic-based inference and data handling.
- HTML for the frontend interface.
